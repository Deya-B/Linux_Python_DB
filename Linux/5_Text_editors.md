# Text editors
## The vi editor
Text editor that comes with all Linux distributions. <br>
It's screen oriented, doesn't have GUI, meaning that is only text input. <br>
Two modes of operation:
- Command mode: typed characters are interpreted as commands that do something to the text file
- Insert mode: typed characters are directly added to the text being edited

vim ([vi improved](www.vim.org)) is included as vi in most distributions.

### Basic vi commands:
* `vi <filename>` ↠ Start editor (Example: `vi temp.txt` vi will create the file “temp.txt”)
* `i, a` ↠ Input mode: (i) Insert text before cursor, (a) after cursor
* `:x <return>` ↠ Exit saving file
* `:q! <return>` ↠ Exit without saving
* `k, j, h, l` ↠ Move cursor up, down, left, right
* `0, $` ↠ Move cursor to beginning, end of the current line
* `u` ↠ Undo last change
* `Esc` ↠ Exit insert mode and go back to command mode
* `x, dd` ↠ Delete single character, entire line

### Creating a file:
At the command prompt type:
```Nushell
vi temp.txt
```

Press the `i` key to switch to input mode.
Type something like:
```Nushell
  VI is great! I think I'll be using vi from 
  now on instead of Word

  # Press <enter> to add lines.
  Type some more text...

          # Don't experiment much, you will screw up...
```

Save the file that you are in:
- Press `ESC` to enter the command mode (an believe you are in it)
- Type `:wq` to save and quit the file (notice the `:` before the wq!)

### Navigation, copy/paste and editing in vi
1. We will enter a file to Edit it... but let's start at the bottom of the file.
    > [!TIP]
    > Opening a file with THE "+" OPTION opens the file and places the cusor at the end of the file. Handy for long config files.
    ```Nushell
    vi + longfile.txt
    ```
2. Go to the first line of the file. Then go to line 10...
    ```Nushell
    :1
    
    # Go to line 10
    :10
    ```
3. Add a new line by pressing the “o” key, and add in some lines of text:
    ```Nushell
    ##
    ## For example you can add a comment :)
    ##
    ```
4. Delete the three lines you just created:
    - Press `ESC`
    - Then move to the first line of new text
    - Press `dd` to delete the whole line, repeat until the text is gone

5. Save the file, but don’t exit:
    ```Nushell
    :w
    # press <enter>
    ```

#### Copying and pasting text
1. Go to line 12, copy 3 lines of text, go to the bottom of the file, place the text there:
    ```Nushell
    ESC
    :12    # go to line 12 of the file
    3yy    # “yank” 3 lines and place in copy buffer = COPY 3 lines
    G      # go to the end of the file
    p      # place the contents of the copy buffer here = PASTE
    ```
2. If want to undo this you would type (in command mode):
    ```Nushell
    u      # Undo the last change       
    ```
3. Go to the top of the file, replace all occurrences of “A” with “X”, but prompt for each change:
    ```Nushell
    ESC
    :1
    :%s/A/X/gc
    ```
    Say “yes” or “no” to a few prompts. <br>
    Escape from this mode by pressing ^c {Ctrl+c} and {ENTER}.

5. Go to line 1, search for “kernel”, move to the end of the line, add some text:
    ```Nushell
    ESC
    :1
    /kernel        # u otra palabra que esté en tu texto
    ```
   Press `n` to travel between the words that match the pattern.

    ```Nushell
    SHIFT-A        # Press to start writing at the end of the line.
    Add some text
    ESC
    ```

6. Now let’s exit from the file and not save the few changes we’ve made.
  ```Nushell
  :q!
  ```
### More practice:
As you should be able to see vi is extremely powerful as an editor, but not necessarily intuitive. The best way to get good at using vi is to practice.

#### Open a file and practice the following
##### Moving around:
  - By word  `w` or `b`
  - End of line `A` or `$`
  - Start of line `^`
  - Top of file `1G`
  - Bottom of file `G`
  - To an absolute line number `:n`

##### Copy, paste, search, replace:
- Copying and pasting multiple lines (use vi commands,`nyy`)
- Copying and pasting single lines (use vi commands, `yy` & `P` or `p`)
- Copying and pasting multiple lines (use your mouse buffer)
- Copying and pasting single lines (use your mouse buffer)
- Search for items backwards and forwards `?string` or `/string`
- Replacing text  `:s/pattern /string /flags`

[GNU Emacs Reference Card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf)

## Basic usage
- Start emacs with the command: `emacs`
- Launch the emacs tutorial by typing: `Ctrl+h t`
- Exit: `C-x C-c`
- Cancel a partially introduced command: `C-g`

Emacs commands involve the use of:
- the Control key (called CTRL or CTL) here is called C. For example:
    - `C-\<car\>` Means: Hold the CTRL key while typing the character car.
    - `C-f>` Means: Hold the Control key and type f.
- the Meta key (called EDIT or ALT) here is called M. For example:
    - `M-\<car\>` Means: Hold the ALT key while typing car.
- >> on the left side: indicate instructions for you tu use a command
