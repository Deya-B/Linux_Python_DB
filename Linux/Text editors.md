## The vi editor
Text editor that comes with all Linux distributions. <br>
Screen oriented, no GUI, only text input. <br>
Two modes of operation:
- Command mode: typed characters are interpreted as commands that do something to the text file
- Insert mode: typed characters are directly added to the text being edited
vim (vi improved, www.vim.org) is included as vi in most distributions
