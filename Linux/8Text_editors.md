# Text editors
## The vi editor
Text editor that comes with all Linux distributions. <br>
Screen oriented, no GUI, only text input. <br>
Two modes of operation:
- Command mode: typed characters are interpreted as commands that do something to the text file
- Insert mode: typed characters are directly added to the text being edited

vim ([vi improved](www.vim.org)) is included as vi in most distributions.

### Basic vi commands:
* Start:                ```vi <filename>```
* Exit saving file:    ```:x <return>```
* Exit without saving: ```:q! <return>```
* Move cursor up, down, left, right: ```k, j, h, l```
* Move cursor to beginning, end of the current line: ```0, $```
* Undo last change: ```u```
* Insert text before cursor, after cursor: ```i, a```
* Exit insert mode and go back to command mode: ```Esc```
* Delete single character, entire line: ```x, dd```
