## Linux Regular expressions
- Special characters which help search data and matching complex patterns.
- Regular expressions are shortened as ‘regexp’ or ‘regex’.
- They are used in many Linux programs like grep, bash, rename, sed, etc.

### Basic Regular expressions

| Symbol | Description | 
| ------ | ----------- | 
| . | matches any character
| ∧ | only match at the beginning of a line| 
| $ | only match at the end of a line | 

A group of characters within brackets [ ] match any character in the
group
If the first symbol within the brackets is ∧, the pattern matches any
character not in the group
The symbol * after a character or expression means zero or more
repetitions
